unity-scope-mediascanner (0.2+14.04.20140319.1-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Try to get proxy for online scope on search() if not set yet (e.g.
    not available on startup), to work around the problem with no remote
    scopes on first run (till network gets configured and phone is
    rebooted).

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Add icons and screenshots to the media scopes.

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Buffer up online results until first local result is displayed, or
    local search finishes (whichever comes first). Query grooveshark

    displayed by Music aggregator scope. (LP: #1281602)

  * Add icons and screenshots to the media scopes.

  [ James Henstridge ]
  * Port scope to new media scanner and scopes APIs.

  * Add mime type to music results.

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Set mediascanner scopes timeout to -1.

  [ James Henstridge ]

  [ Pawel Stolowski ]
  * Set empty icon hint instead of fallback icon.
